Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System
Overview
This project implements a secure Authentication and Authorization system with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) using Python and Flask. The system ensures that users can access specific resources based on their assigned roles (e.g., Admin, Moderator, User).

Features
Secure Authentication: Users can register, log in, and log out securely.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Access to endpoints is restricted based on roles.
JWT Authentication: JSON Web Tokens are used for session management.
Database Integration: User credentials and roles are stored securely in a database.
Dynamic Role Management: Easily add or modify roles and permissions.
Middleware Enforcement: Role checks implemented via decorators for clean code.
